        <h4>Glossop Camera Club</h4>
        <p>The aim of the club is to bring together like minded friends interested in Photography, at all levels, to exhibit within the group each other's photographs
		from time to time and to enjoy social meets. From Jun-2019 <a href="meetings.html">meetings</a> are held on an Ad hoc basis, outdoors and indoors. Outdoor meets are open to suggestions from all members and are designed to be at places locally of photographic interest.
		Indoor meets are also open to member suggestions and have previously involved indoor photography, using a model, camera techniques, special effects, and film projector shows of members's photographs. Studio lighting is available (owned by the club) as is a Projector (also owned by the club). Members can bring along Photographs on a memory stick and a laptop, linked to the projector.</p>
		<p>The club is not instructional. Members sometimes offer experience and help to others. It is more a Social Group.</p>
		<p><b>Your Club</b>
		<br />It is your Club. Feel free to suggest any topics or activities you would like included in meetings, indoors or out. Whatever camera you use, from camera phone to DSLR, all are welcome.</p>
